    "bio":"I started mobile development back on 2011, when only a native approach (Java / Obj-C) was possible for building mobile apps. On 2018 I discovered React Native and continued working until today. During my career, I have also worked with databases, AWS, APIs and small websites (this site is hosted in AWS using a cloudfront and static website in S3). In my free time I usually play videogames with friends and cook.",
